    <p>An HPV based screen-and-treat approach with ablative therapy can prevent cervical cancer. Patients who test
        positive for HPV, the cause of cervical cancer, can receive ablative therapy treatment at a clinic on the same
        day. The WHO recommends this approach, but ablative therapy is new and, though it is safe, the experience
        patients receive this treatment is not well understood. </p>
    <p>In this study, we aimed to understand whether patients found ablative therapy treatment acceptable and feasible.
        We found that, although patients experienced minor side effects, they experienced satisfaction and relief, and
        wanted this treatment to be available at more clinics.</p>
