    <p>Dementia affects millions of people worldwide, with the number of people affected expected to grow rapidly. 
        Current prevention strategies focus on modifying lifestyle factors, like diet and physical activity. However, 
        scaling-up these prevention strategies to reach all the people who can benefit from them is challenging.</p>
    <p>This study explored how to best scale-up and implement lifestyle-based dementia prevention programs in the UK. 
        We discussed the APPLE-Tree program with participants, which is one of the lifestyle-based dementia prevention 
        programs currently in clinical trials.</p>
    <p>We found that health care professionals believed dementia prevention programs could improve memory and 
        wellbeing, but they emphasized the need for clear guidance on how to run the programs and solutions to address 
        funding and staffing shortages. We suggest dementia prevention programs aim to address these challenges in 
        order to successfully scale-up and ultimately reduce dementia prevalence.</p>
