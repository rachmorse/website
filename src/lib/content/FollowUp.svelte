    <p>In many cervical cancer prevention programs, patients with positive screening results are referred to the
        hospital for additional tests and treatment. However, in the Amazonian region of Peru, 70% of patients referred
        to the hospital were not receiving the care they needed. </p>
    <p>In this study, we set out to understand why so many patients were not able to receive care. We found that, while
        patients were strongly motivated, they encountered many challenges. One main challenge was an inadequate
        registration system where there was often no information about each patients’ care. Other challenges were
        structural, such as long wait times or doctor strikes. Others were financial, including high cost of travel to
        the hospital, and others were cognitive, such as not receiving clear information from healthcare providers. We
        suggest that cervical cancer programs focus on addressing these barriers.</p>
