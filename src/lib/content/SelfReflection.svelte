    <p>Dementia is a devastating disease that affects over 50 million people worldwide. However, up to one third of cases can be prevented by addressing modifiable risk factors, such as poor diet and lack of physical activity. Psychological factors that may increase dementia risk have received less attention. This study examined one of them, self-reflection, which involves actively assessing your own thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. We found that older adults who engaged in more self-reflection had better memory performance and higher glucose metabolism. These factors are both protective against Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia.</p>
