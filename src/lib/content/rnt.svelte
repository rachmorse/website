    <p>While cognitive and physical health are often seen as separate, they are closely related, especially as we age. 
        Understanding what affects both can help in developing better interventions for healthy aging. Here we explored how 
        worry and rumination—persistent negative thoughts—affect the physical and cognitive health of older adults. </p>
    <p>We found that increased worry and rumination were not significantly associated with objective health measures; however, 
        they were associated with poorer subjective physical and cognitive health, meaning older adults who engaged in negative 
        thinking tended to report having poorer health. Developing interventions that target these negative thinking styles may 
        improve how older adults feel and function in daily life, ultimately supporting healthier aging. </p>

        This figure depicts the results of our research on worry and rumination and their relationship with subjective and 
        objective cognitive and physical health.

            These figures show the relationship between worry and rumination and subjective health.
            The top figures show that as worry and rumination increase perceived physical health decreases. 
            The bottom figures show that as worry and rumination increase so do cognitive difficulties, such as poorer memory.
