    <p>Cervical cancer is preventable but requires early detection and timely treatment, including ensuring all patients 
        receive the care they need. In the Amazonian region of Peru, 70% of patients referred to the hospital were not 
        receiving the care they needed. Our team implemented a new cervical cancer prevention program, and the hard-working 
        staff in this region were able to reduce the rate of patients who do not receive follow up care to 30%. Still, it 
        is important that all patients receive appropriate care, and so, in this study, we explored why these patients, 
        did not receive care after we implemented the new cervical cancer prevention program. </p>
    <p>We found an incomplete patient monitoring system, which made it challenging to for staff to deliver results. 
        Patients wanted treatment but faced a lack of understanding about HPV, fear of treatment, and work-related barriers. 
        We encourage healthcare systems to ensure they have complete the registry systems for patient follow-up, and to 
        also use patient navigators who can help in providing better educational materials and support to patients. </p>
